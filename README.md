# Handyman Helper LLC - Business Website
Welcome to the repository for the Handyman Helper LLC business website. This project serves as a showcase for the website I created for Handyman Helper LLC, a handyman services company. In this README, you'll find an overview of the project, the tools and technologies used, lessons learned, and a conclusion.

# Project Overview
Handyman Helper LLC needed an online presence to reach a wider audience and showcase their services. This project aimed to design and develop a responsive and user-friendly website that not only provides information about the company but also includes a contact form for potential clients to get in touch easily.

# What I Did
* Built a Business Website: I designed and developed the Handyman Helper LLC website from scratch. The website includes multiple pages, such as a home page, services offered, about us, contact page, and a blog section.
* Contact Form with PHP: I implemented a contact form using PHP to allow users to send inquiries or requests for quotes. This form securely collects user data and sends it to the company's designated email address.

# Tools Used
* HTML: I used HTML to structure the content of the website and create web pages.
* CSS: CSS was used for styling the website, making it visually appealing and responsive across various devices.
* PHP: I used PHP for server-side scripting to handle the contact form and process user input.

# What I Learned
While working on this project, I gained valuable experience in:

* Web Development: I improved my skills in web development, including HTML, CSS, and PHP, by building a real-world website for a business.
* User Experience (UX) Design: I learned how to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface to enhance the overall user experience.
* Form Handling with PHP: Implementing a contact form with PHP allowed me to learn about form validation, data handling, and email functionality.

# Conclusion
Creating the Handyman Helper LLC website was a rewarding experience. It not only helped me expand my web development skills but also contributed to enhancing the online presence of a local business. I am proud of the result and look forward to further refining and expanding this project in the future.
